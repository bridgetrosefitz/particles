## Why I made it

These particles started as an experiment for my personal website. I find the dancing dots endlessly beautiful - please have a play!

I built custom GLSL shaders in Three.js to transform photos into millions of tiny dots, and to allow the user to disturb the dots' movements by dragging their cursor.

## How it's made

### Technology

* [React.js](https://reactjs.org/)
* [Three.js](https://threejs.org/) (implemented with [React Three Fiber](https://github.com/pmndrs/react-three-fiber)) 
* [drei](https://drei.pmnd.rs/)
* [GSAP](https://greensock.com/gsap/)

### I couldn't have made it without the help of...

* Bruno Simon, a Three.js afficionado. I took his three.js journey course, and you can too [here](https://threejs-journey.xyz/). Or visit Bruno's amazing portfolio [here](https://bruno-simon.com/)
